# RESEARCH: SOTA Cognitive Memory for AI Agents

To position Cortex as the leader in agentic memory systems, we must evolve beyond standard hybrid search (BM25 + Vectors) toward a fully relational and dynamic memory tier. Current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) systems solve complex multi-hop reasoning and long-term context retention through two major architectural paradigms:

## 1. Context Paging (MemGPT / Letta Paradigm)

Standard RAG crams context into a prompt until it overflows. MemGPT approaches context like Operating System memory management:
- **Working Memory (RAM):** The LLM's active context window (`main_context`).
- **External Memory (Disk):** Vector stores or databases (`archival_memory` / `recall_memory`).
- **Mechanism:** The agent is given function calls (tools) to explicitly `page_in()` or `page_out()` memories. It decides what to remember, what to drop, and what to search for.
- **Cortex Refinement Application:** Instead of our System 1 fetching data blindly, we must allow System 2 (Reasoning) to trigger "memory paging" tool calls if it detects it lacks context. 

## 2. Relational & Temporal Memory (GraphRAG / Graphiti Paradigm)

While vector stores are good at semantic similarity ("find documents like this"), they fail at structural logic ("who reported to whom in 2022?").
- **GraphRAG:** By combining Knowledge Graphs with LLMs, memory is stored as Entities (Nodes) and Relationships (Edges). The retrieval traverses graphs to perform multi-hop reasoning. 
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs:** Systems like Zep's Graphiti engine store facts along timelines. When an entity state changes over time, it records the temporal validity of that relationship.
- **Cortex Refinement Application:** Cortex already includes an unfinished `belief_graph.rs`. We must elevate this Graph to a full Temporal GraphRAG implementation. The `System 2` reasoning engine should map entities and relationships, rather than just text chunks.

## 3. The Multi-Tier Human Memory Model

Modern agents classify memory logically:
- **Working Memory:** The active session ID and immediate conversation.
- **Episodic Memory:** Sequences of past interactions (event subgraph).
- **Semantic Memory:** Factual world knowledge (vector + graph semantics).
- **Procedural Memory:** Instructions and tool mastery.

## Strategic Execution Plan for Cortex

To beat standard testing benchmarks and rival enterprise AI memory:
1. **Prioritize the Belief Graph (GraphRAG):** Finalize `belief_graph.rs` to extract Entity-Relationship triples during `System 1` retrieval.
2. **Implement Agent-Driven Paging:** Give `System 2` tools to query `QmdMemory` autonomously in a loop (Threshold-based Auto-Reflection from Issue #35) instead of a single fire-and-forget query.
3. **Hybrid Verification:** System 1 should return both Semantic Clusters and Graph Sub-networks, pushing them to System 2 for logic validation.
