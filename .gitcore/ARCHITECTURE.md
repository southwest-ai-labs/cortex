# Architecture: AgentRAG

## Core Philosophy
AgentRAG is a single Rust binary acting as a multi-agent RAG swarm, inspired by the **"System 3" paradigm** (Rational Thought, Meta-Cognition, and Error Correction). This system transcends simple vector retrieval by implementing strict reasoning and self-reflection layers before serving responses.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Rust
- **Runtime**: Tokio (for massive asynchronous parallelism across agent swarms)
- **Framework**: `zavora-ai/adk-rust` (Agent Development Kit for agnostic, modular agent building)
- **Database / Memory**: SurrealDB (Unifies Vector Search and Graph relations for Shared Memory and Belief Graphs)

## Agent Swarm Layers
1. **System 1 (Retrievers)**: Fast instinct-like agents powered by SurrealDB Vector Search to fetch raw context and immediate facts quickly.
2. **System 2 (Reasoners)**: Deliberate agents implementing Chain of Thought (CoT) to construct logical answers based on System 1's context.
3. **System 3 (Overseer/Critic)**: Meta-cognitive agents that overrule and evaluate System 2's reasoning. They check reasoning steps against a Formal Belief Graph (Graph Nodes in SurrealDB). If anomalies, contradictions or hallucinations are detected, the response is vetoed and sent back for re-evaluation.
